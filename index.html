    <!-- Chosen Palette: "Calm Neutrals" - A calming, academic-themed palette using warm neutrals (stone, amber) for a focused, non-distracting study environment. Accents are used sparingly for interactive elements. -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A two-column responsive layout was chosen for optimal user experience. The left column provides persistent navigation, allowing users to jump between topics without scrolling. The right column is the dynamic content area. This structure facilitates non-linear learning and quick comparison, which is ideal for a student cramming for an interview. On mobile, the layout stacks vertically for easy scrolling. Key interactions include toggling between C/C++ and Python code snippets and an "Interview Mode" switch to reveal professional-level explanations, implementing a progressive disclosure pattern to avoid overwhelming the user. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: The source report's content is primarily textual and comparative (code vs. code, casual vs. professional explanation). Therefore, interactive text and code blocks were chosen over data charts. The primary goal is to compare and organize information. This is achieved through: 1) A clickable navigation list (Goal: Organize). 2) Tabbable code blocks (Goal: Compare). 3) A toggle switch to show/hide interview answers (Goal: Inform/Drill-down). These choices directly support the user's task of quick revision and comparison. Chart.js was not used as there is no quantitative data to visualize. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->

                explanation: "It's how you talk to computers, like using Hindi or English to talk to people. Computers are super dumb and need precise instructions. You give commands using languages like C, C++, or Python. If you mess up the grammar (syntax!), the computer won't understand and won't run your code. The ultimate goal is to automate tasks, from complex calculations to running your favorite video game.",
                professional_answer: "A programming language is a formal set of instructions that allows humans to communicate with computers and develop software. It provides a structured syntax and semantics for writing commands that a computer can interpret and execute. Essentially, it acts as the intermediary, translating human logic into machine-understandable code. Common examples include C, C++, and Python, each with its own strengths and applications for different types of programming tasks, ranging from system-level programming to web development and data science.",

                explanation: "Loops let you repeat actions without writing the same code over and over. Like telling your friend, \"Do 10 push-ups!\" (he repeats it 10 times). A `for` loop is usually for when you know how many times to repeat, and a `while` loop is for when you repeat as long as a condition remains true.",
                professional_answer: "A loop is a control structure that allows repeated execution of a block of code as long as a specified condition is met or for a predefined number of iterations. The `for` loop is typically used for iterating over a sequence or a fixed range, while the `while` loop continues execution as long as its condition remains true. Loops are essential for automating repetitive tasks and processing collections of data.",

                explanation: "A pointer is like a slip of paper with an address written on it. It doesn't hold the actual data, but tells you *where* that data is stored in the computer's memory. This lets you directly mess with memory. (Bhai, Python mein yeh nahi hota! Python handles all the memory stuff for you automatically, so you don't directly deal with pointers.)",
                professional_answer: "A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. Pointers are extensively used in C and C++ for direct memory access, dynamic memory allocation, and efficient array manipulation. They offer fine-grained control over memory but also introduce risks like memory leaks and segmentation faults. Python, being a higher-level language, abstracts away direct memory management; variables in Python are references to objects, not pointers to memory addresses in the C/C++ sense.",
                code_cpp: `int var = 10; // An integer variable\nint *ptr = &var; // 'ptr' is a pointer storing the memory address of 'var'\nprintf("Value of var: %d\\n", *ptr); // '*ptr' dereferences the pointer, giving the value at that address`,
                code_python: `# Python does not have explicit pointers in the C/C++ sense.\n# All variables in Python are references to objects, and the interpreter handles memory management automatically.\n# This simplifies programming but removes direct memory access.`,

                practical_python: `# In Python, swapping variables is much simpler due to its nature of handling references:\na = 5\nb = 10\na, b = b, a # Swaps the values of a and b directly\n# a is now 10, b is now 5`,
